# rSSOAP

## lorem ipsum

Analyis using the [EPA SSOAP](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/sanitary-sewer-overflow-analysis-and-planning-ssoap-toolbox) toolbox typically relies on weeks or months of flow meter and rain gauge data at timesteps ranging from 15-min to 1-hr. *up tonal comment*.  Instead, rSSOAP relies on 2 or more years of daily flow meter and rain gauge data.
